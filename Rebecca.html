                    <li class="list-group-item">Artificial intelligence is making a huge impact on sport as the technology which it provides is enabling players to enhance their performance and coaches to train their athletes in the most effective way possible. AI can deliver players and coaches with performance analytics which gives players and coaches the incredible tool to analyze their performance and explore their opponents strengths and weaknesses as well. In addition, AI can enhance the spectator experience. Cameras which capture sporting events are not able to pick up the highlights and best moments of the game, to distribute to television outlets and mobile devices for others to view</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><h4>Sportlogiq</h4>Sportlogiq is an artificial intelligence powered company transforming the in which teams and fans experience the game. Using computer vision and machine learning, its platform tracks and analyses the movements of every player and generates deep data insights. Monitoring more than 158 million data points per game, it helps professional sports teams win more matches and broadcasters tell better stories. They do it by using standard, single-camera game footage and flag, timestamp and record the XY coordinates of specific game events, such as shots, passes and possesion. The player-location data is then transformed into meaningful and actionable insights for teams, automated stories for broadcast media, and in-depth insights for sports betting. The end goal is to understand a player’s behaviour. Computer vision, or more precisely, tracking, activity recognition, and group activity analysis tell us where everyone is and what they are doing at any given time. This information can be used to infer who is going to score the next goal, win the game, or win the World Cup. Coaches and players are looking for actionable insights, such as pressure and space creation—an important part of the modern football game. These are the kinds of stats, and full game context, that Sportlogiq provides and teams are using this information to improve their game.</li>

While he's making his run, the Japanese defender is tracking his run and going with him - allowing space to be created and another run to happen in that area</b><br><br><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.sportspromedia.com/images/uploads/blogs/SPORTLOGiQ_lukaku_dummy.png" alt="2018 Fifa World Cup: Belgium 3-2 Japan" width="1000px"><br><br><b>This is important because when Lukaku is in direct relation to the ball and plays a dummy, the Japanese defender was with him all along, and by playing the 'dummy', he takes the Japanese player out of the game twice - once on the initial pass to Meunier, and the other from the pass to Nacer Chadli, who tapped in the game-winning goal. Lukaku essentially created space by breaking down the Japanese defence with two runs and a dummy - all without touching the ball</b></li>
