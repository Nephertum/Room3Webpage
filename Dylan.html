                      Ai in Twitter is used in a variety of ways, one that may be familiar to most people is content curation.
                      Say you look at a tweet, the AI will check the tweet you looked at, any images or other form of media inside the tweet,
                      any links inside the tweet, people or hashtags mentioned, aswell as the content other people like who viewed that tweet,
                      with weighting applied if the tweet causes engagement in some way (likes, retweets, or comments). The algorithm to do this
                      progressivly gets better and better at providing content to increase engagement with the site and provide the user with
                      content, as increase engagement also means the AI will have more content to work with.
                      <br><br>
                      Of course recommendations inside user feeds are not the only use for AI on Twitter, another important use nescary for
                      sites continued existance is content moderation, here AI is used to check for inappropriate content that may break Twitter
                      guidelines. Here the AI will be trained in a variety of ways, such as being shown inappropriate content and asking it to compare
                      other images to see if they are also inappropriate (again, this is an iterative process which progressively gets better over time).
                      For example in 2017 Twitter continued it's crackdown on terrorist supporting content, removing some 300'000 accounts, 95% of which
                      were identified by Twitters AI. This AI is based of off IBM Watson, which already had the ability to read messages and understand
                      the content of images.
                      <br><br>
                      One final way Twitter uses AI to improve it's site and help users is by removing bots, bots can be used to artificially change
                      the content a user is provided be it by swarming posts with 1000's of likes to spamming hashtags to give the appearance of a popular
                      trend. Bots are also used in harrasment campaigns against specific users or groups of users. To combat this Twitter aswell as number
                      of other social media platforms invested in AI to identify these bots, by comparing what the bots do to what an average user would,
                      this doesn't just end at the type of content being produced, or what is written, or even the amount of numbers in a username, but
                      can also be times between post, the amount of engagement, and when the accounts are engaged (do they only activate to tweet about a
                      certain hashtag every few months?). Like any AI it is always improving, but unlike the other two examples given here the problem being
                      solved is getting ever more complicated itself as the bots will continously improve and adapt themselves be it by their creators or by
                      their own self-learning algorithms.
