                      Ai in Twitter is used in a variety of ways, one that may be familiar to most people is content curation. 
                      Say you look at a tweet, the AI will check the tweet you looked at, any images or other form of media inside the tweet, 
                      any links inside the tweet, people or hashtags mentioned, as well as the content other people like who viewed that tweet, 
                      with weighting applied if the tweet causes engagement in some way (likes, retweets, or comments). The algorithm to do this 
                      progressively gets better and better at providing content to increase engagement with the site and provide the user with 
                      content, as increase engagement also means the AI will have more content to work with. 
                      <br><br> 
                      Of course, recommendations inside user feeds are not the only use for AI on Twitter, another important use necessary for 
                      sites continued existence is content moderation, here AI is used to check for inappropriate content that may break Twitter 
                      guidelines. Here the AI will be trained in a variety of ways, such as being shown inappropriate content and asking it to compare 
                      other images to see if they are also inappropriate (again, this is an iterative process which progressively gets better over time). 
                      For example, in 2017 Twitter continued its crackdown on terrorist supporting content, removing some 300'000 accounts, 95% of which 
                      were identified by Twitters AI. This AI is based of off IBM Watson, which already had the ability to read messages and understand 
                      the content of images. 
                      <br> 
                      <img src="Images/Bots.png" alt="Bots" width="30%" height="30%" class="center">
                      <br>
                      One final way Twitter uses AI to improve its site and help users is by removing bots, bots can be used to artificially change 
                      the content a user is provided be it by swarming posts with 1000's of likes to spam hashtags to give the appearance of a popular 
                      trend. Bots are also used in harassment campaigns against specific users or groups of users. To combat this Twitter as well as number 
                      of other social media platforms invested in AI to identify these bots, by comparing what the bots do to what an average user would, 
                      this does not just end at the type of content being produced, or what is written, or even the number of numbers in a username, but 
                      can also be times between post, the amount of engagement, and when the accounts are engaged (do they only activate to tweet about a 
                      certain hashtag every few months?). Like any AI it is always improving, but unlike the other two examples given here the problem being 
                      solved is getting ever more complicated itself as the bots will continuously improve and adapt themselves be it by their creators or by 
                      their own self-learning algorithms.

                      A lot of ways Facebook user AI is to improve advertising. Whilst not immediately obvious how this helps society at large is it’s advertising 
                      like this that allow social media sites to operate for free and provide access to everyone Irregardless of income. Improvements to 
                      advertisement also means people are more aware of products they may like, further improved by Facebook curating them similar products. 
                      Finally, improvements to advertisements also helps businesses on the platform giving them access to a wide variety of potential consumers 
                      and new methods of advertising. All of this is facilitated by a series of AI employed by Facebook. 
                      <br><br> 
                      Facebook firstly uses Deep Text, which intends to understand language not by comparing words used to those in a dictionary, but rather 
                      understanding words in the context they are used, so the AI can also understand slang terms or differences in spelling. This can be varying 
                      useful into the study of language, and can potentially help with AI attempting to translate phrases so the translation more accurately 
                      reflects the meaning and not just a direct translation of what was said (more on this later); for Facebook itself the opportunities are 
                      more precis as it can provide a lot of advertising data such as how users are discussing products and to who, as well as matching users 
                      more precisely to certain products based on how the user speaks. 
                      <br><br> 
                      Facebook, like google, had developed its own machine translating system, the uses should be immediately obvious, but in case it isn't 
                      translation features can more easily facilitate communication between users with different language backgrounds, allow advertisers to 
                      easily translate their adverts. Facebook translation AI process information on words in a hierarchy, so whilst Google's will work by 
                      by translating a word and trying to find what the subsequent word could be Facebook will take a word and work through a hierarchy of 
                      meaning to try and get the next word. Important to us is this allows Facebook's AI to look for non-linear relationships within the data 
                      thus allowing the AI to better understand contextual meaning. Being attached to Facebook as a social media site greatly helps these efforts 
                      as the AI has a near endless amount of data to work with when translating, and users themselves do not have to use the AI itself but 
                      instead do their own translation wherever possible which does help the AI better translate such phrases in the future. 
                      <br>
                      <img src="Images/GrokNet.png" alt="GrokNet" width="70%" height="10%" class="center"> 
                      <br> 
                      Finally, Facebook is developing “GrokNet” whose purpose will be to identify products from the photos they appear in, for example if a 
                      person is wearing some kind of shirt inside of a photo the AI will not just be able to identify that the thing being worn is a shirt, but 
                      will pick out other features such as material, colour, and the maker of said shirt, it will also extend to other products such as vehicle and 
                      appliances. This will be a great advertising tool in getting products showcased as to give all relevant details about a product all a company 
                      would have to do is post an image of it and let Facebook do the rest of the work. The benefits to the average Facebook user will be that
                      anything that they see in image that they like will be easily findable for them and benefits the convenience of the user.
