                <h2>Covid-19</h2>
                <ul class = "list-group list-group-flush">
                    <li class="list-group-item">In this worldwide health crisis, the medical industry is looking for new technologies to monitor and controls the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. AI is one of such technology which can easily track the spread of this virus, identifies the high-risk patients, and is useful in controlling this infection in real-time. It can also predict mortality risk by adequately analyzing the previous data of the patients. AI can help us to fight this virus by population screening, medical help, notification, and suggestions about the infection control. This technology has the potential to improve the planning, treatment and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">AI can quickly analyze irregular symptom and other ‘red flags’ and thus alarm the patients and the healthcare authorities. It helps to provide faster decision making, which is cost-effective. It helps to develop a new diagnosis and management system for the COVID 19 cases, through useful algorithms. AI is helpful in the diagnosis of the infected cases with the help of medical imaging technologies like Computed tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of human body parts.

                      AI can build an intelligent platform for automatic monitoring and prediction of the spread of this virus. A neural network can also be developed to extract the visual features of this disease, and this would help in proper monitoring and treatment of the affected individuals. It has the capability of providing day-to-day updates of the patients and also to provide solutions to be followed in COVID-19 pandemic.
                      </li> 
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                      AI can help analyze the level of infection by this virus identifying the clusters and ‘hot spots’ and can successfully do the contact tracing of the individuals and also to monitor them. It can predict the future course of this disease and likely reappearance.
                      
                      This technology can track and forecast the nature of the virus from the available data, social media and media platforms, about the risks of the infection and its likely spread. Further, it can predict the number of positive cases and death in any region. AI can help identify the most vulnerable regions, people and countries and take measures accordingly.

                    <h2>Disease Spread Modelling</h2>
                    <img src="https://yoshuabengio.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/erik-mclean-sIg5RzqmV3o-unsplash-scaled.jpg" width=750>
                    <ul class = "list-group list-group-flush">
                        <li class="list-group-item">Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms belonging to the class of bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><h2>Contact Tracing</h2>Artificial intelligence technologies are being used in varied ways to combat the pandemic. For example, AI has been used to identify and track the spread of the virus. A Canadian company, BlueDot was among the first in the world to identify the emerging risk from COVID-19 in Hubei province and to publish a first scientific paper on COVID-19, accurately predicting its global spread using its proprietary models. AI technologies such as chatbots are being used as virtual assistants to provide information about the virus. AI is also been used to help diagnose the disease including via the use of diagnostic robots, to predict which patients will likely develop severe symptoms requiring treatment, to develop drugs, and find cures including through literature searches for clues to cures buried in heaps of scientific literature. Data-mining operations have been conducted on large datasets to build predictive computer models to provide real-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed. AI has also found uses to monitor for crowd formations to help enforce social distancing rules. Some of these uses raise privacy compliance issues as they involve, amongst other things, the collection, use, aggregation, analysis and disclosure to third parties of datasets that may or may not include de-identified or re-identifiable data.</li> 
                        <li class="list-group-item"><h2>Detecting Future Outbreaks</h2>Over the past couple of decades, 75% of the infectious diseases the CDC has documented have been zoonotic – that is, capable of spreading from animals to humans. In the past, by the time scientists identified host species, the disease had already leaped to humans, leaving mitigation as the only response.
                        
                          Researchers now use AI to identify the ecological and epidemiological patterns that lead up to epidemics to predict outbreaks before they happen. Mathematical models and machine learning can analyze huge amounts of data to get clues about the next likely source of infection. These predictions help ecologists protect and monitor possible host species, potentially preventing future outbreaks.
                          
                          For example, teams at the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies have created a computer model to choose rodent species with high disease-carrying potential. The model scanned 2,277 species and found 58 likely potential hosts, two of which have now been confirmed to harbor pathogens. The organization also used AI and machine learning to predict which types of bats could carry filoviruses like Ebola with a model that uses 57 factors (e.g., life history, ecology data) to calculate predictions.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><h2>Resource Distribution</h2>When responding to infectious disease outbreaks, public health officials make difficult decisions about how and where to allocate scarce resources. AI can guide those decisions to make them as efficient and effective as possible.

                          Once AI predicts where a disease will travel next, officials can set up travel checkpoints and call for a ramp-up of hospital resources in the right places. Researchers who combine AI with simulation models can assess the effectiveness of various policy responses.
                          
                          Additionally, AI algorithms can determine what populations would best benefit from public health communications to prevent or slow disease. A team at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering created such an algorithm, using real tuberculosis data, that takes into account human behavior patterns and disease transmission. Officials have used similar algorithms to help prevent HIV and Hepatitis C.</li>
