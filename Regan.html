                    <li class="list-group-item">Veo Robotics has an industrial robotics system that combines computer vision, AI and sensors. This setup allows the machines to work at full speed unless humans get too close.
                        As such, robots are no longer confined behind cages, but human safety is still a priority. Veo Robotics’ technology enables a robot to dynamically assess how far it must remain from a person to avoid hitting it.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">An example of how you would train a robot via machine learning can be found from the Shadow Robot Company and our work with OpenAI, founded by business tycoons, Elon Musk and Sam Altman. When OpenAI researchers took our hardware, they explored machine learning by creating a robotic system called DACTYL in which a virtual robotic hand learns through trial and error. These human-like strategies were then transferred to the Shadow Dexterous Hand in the natural world enabling it to grasp and manipulate objects efficiently</li> 
                    <li class="list-group-item">A major research area involving robots and AI is in medical technologies. Robots in the future could perform surgery without intervention from a human doctor. As with autonomous vehicles, robotic surgeons could perform delicate operations for longer than human doctors can, without getting tired or making mistakes.</li>

                        <li class="list-group-item">A major application of AI to robotics that has gotten attention in recent years is autonomous or self-driving cars. This kind of application is attractive because human driver error is the most common cause of accidents. A robotic car won’t get tired, impaired, or inattentive the way a human driver can. While there have been a few high-profile accidents involving autonomous vehicles, they have a lot of potential to be safer than human-driven vehicles.<img class="img-fluid" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Waymo_Chrysler_Pacifica_in_Los_Altos%2C_2017.jpg/1200px-Waymo_Chrysler_Pacifica_in_Los_Altos%2C_2017.jpg"></img></li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Autonomous cars have been recently hitting the headlines and dominating tech-talks. They are seen as a post-Uber disruption to public commute and transportation of goods. Surely  they are no figment of imagination in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), which is being used to complement driverless cars.
                            Companies such as Waymo and Tesla are heavily invested in driverless cars. Currently, Waymo has begun testing of driverless cars again after stopping in 2017. Testing is done with drivers inside the vehicles until the company is able to gain enough data to move towards a completely driverless solution.</li> 
                        <li class="list-group-item">But before we get into further details, let us discuss what autonomous means. SAE International has recently updated the visual chart which aims at clarifying the J3016 “Levels of Driving Automation” standard for its customers. This standard serves as a baseline for automated vehicles, and thus contains the following levels:

                            Automation for driver assistance. This is a preliminary level or starting point of car automation where the system assists the driver but does not take control of the car (e.g., parking sensors).
                            
                            <br><b>Partially automated driving.</b> The system takes partial control, but the driver is primarily responsible for the operation of the vehicle.
                            
                            <br><b>Highly automated driving.</b> This allows users to let the system take control of the vehicle for a longer duration of time (e.g., on the highway).
                            
                            <br><b>Fully automated driving.</b> The system is responsible for driving the vehicle without interference from any human. However, the human presence is still needed.
                            
                            <br><b>Completely automated car.</b> The vehicle can completely navigate its way through from one point to another without any assistance from a driver.</li>
